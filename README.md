# Skeleton-Hunt-Game


A simple 3D game created with Unity engine. 
This repository contains only scripts from the game as all files are rather big in size (3D models, textures etc.) 

It's a part of a learning process, inspiration for some mechanics was taken from online tutorials and Unity guides. 

The game is available for download under this link:

Standard Unity assets and some 3D models available in the Unity Asset Store were used. 
Models created by me: crossbow, spear, potions, crates, tent.
